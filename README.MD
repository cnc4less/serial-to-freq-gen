Modified version of the Arduino Software Serial sample (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SoftwareSerialExample)
for certain types of frequency generator that have serial control with a preculiar flavour:

- sent commands must have a continuous block of characters, but no terminating LF or CR
- received responses have LF termination

You can see the videos I made about this device here:
